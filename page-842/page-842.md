## Strategy for building up line value

One of the most enduring difficulties I've faced in bring linework to a finish is in the process of building up the value of the lines themselves in a way that does not seem to tarnish or otherwise harm the liveliness of the underlying sketch.

Notably, these days at least, I believe I work rather softly. Strictly working with a soft touch for as much of the initial development of the sketch as possible. This hasn't always been true, let alone deliberately true. Through early years getting a handle on digital art the standard process was rough lines followed by an utterly painstaking pass of final 'inked' lines. I say painstaking as this was more a process of 'fishing' for the right line through thorough abuse of `ctrl + z`. As anyone new to drawing with a table can attest, the frictionless surface of the average Wacom tablet (a slick grey Wacom Graphire in my case), there is great temptation to work this way. 

Therein lies the first hint at a big problem with finishing your linework - a breakpoint between sketch and final lines. A point at which you stop, reduce the opacity of your sketch thus far and begin anew a layer above with your agonising line-fishing process, typically with a heavier hand and low to no pressure sensitivity bound to opacity. This was further exacerbated by my only real exposure to digital art education being 'How to Draw Manga' type websites and books which even today mostly follow a traditional pencil to pen inking type workflow.

There exists a point at which your momentum grinds to a halt and you literally begin your process of re-drawing the exact same thing once more. Perhaps some of the charm of this process is lost on me but after many years of confronting this breakpoint I freely declare I find it absolutely maddening.

Thus, I've committed no small amount of myself to finding away around this brutal lowpoint in the drawing process.

The afforementioned soft touch is where this begins. The ultimate goal now is to build up a sketch that evolves - as organically as possible - into the final drawing. No additional layers if I can avoid it (Which is not yet as often as I'd like, as I still rely on iterative sketching where necessary).

And crucially, as observed here particularly in the delightful Frog Boy, **not all areas of your drawing need to be pushed to a crisp, solid black, 'inked' finish**. Not right away at least. As a rule, anything approaching a final or finish pass on a drawing should begin where it is needed most. And how should you decide that? Here's a trustworthy heuristic: Do what you *know* needs to be done first. Areas of simply occlusion, solid and obvious cast shadows, things you know for sure need to be pushed. By starting with what you are confident about, not only are you saving troublesome challenges for later (which grants the benefit of discovering later those challenges have been mitigated by the harmony you've already established doing what you know better) and thus building more momentum in your drawing process, but you will find that you are increasingly able to walk away from a drawing and call it done more often than you were before when, perhaps, you were treating your inking pass as if you were an inkjet printer - just starting at the top and working your way down inch by inch, preventing yourself from walking away from the piece until you reach the very bottom of your drawing.

In the case of Frog Boy, I was able to walk away happily without really pushing the lower left side of the drawing very hard at all.

When you're ready to graduate from the 'start with what you are confident about' heuristic, you can incorporate the second species of this strategy - harmonising doing what you know with **doing that which will create the best focus in your drawing**. The later is arguably much more important than the former in the ultimate goal of creating the best drawing possible, but I take momentum and personal confidence throughout the drawing process extremely seriously as I'm very prone to getting beaten up if my workflow contains too many low points.

What is meant by focus? Simply put, prioritise building up lines where they will count most towards a more harmonious and therefore more beautiful drawing. An amateur may not necessarily know where these magic locations are in their drawing, but with mileage and study they will become better known. Thankfully, there are again more tried and tested heuristics available to simplify this process. Take for instance Bryan Lee's frequent insistence that "it all starts with the head" - hopefully I'm doing his teachings justice by explaining this as beginning with that which not only sets up so much of the 'framework' of the rest of the drawing, but also that which is naturally going to command the most immediate attention and scrutiny.

For example, if we observe the nude figure on the left, among my first priorities were pushing the linework in the face - particularly the eyes - to a darker, heavier finish. It is self evident that we are drawn to subject's faces, and we are programmed to interpret the areas of strong dark aroung the eyes, nose, and mouth (likely in that order) in order to fully parse the identity of the person we are looking at. Therefore, we should prioritise pushing these areas first.

From there, I'm free to move on to other obvious opportunities (that is, things I'm confident about doing) by pushing occlusion and overlaps to a heavier finish, such as under the arm or where the lower leg meets the ground.


To summarise:
1. Sketch your initial idea with a soft touch
2. Only push areas of important focus to a heavier finish when you are confident it will enhance the drawing
3. If you don't know where to start, start with what you have the most confidence in
4. Walk away whenever you want
